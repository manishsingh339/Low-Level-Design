**SOLID Principles in Java**

The **SOLID** principles are five key **object-oriented design** principles that help developers build scalable, maintainable, and flexible software.

1. **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
2. **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
3. **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
4. **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
5. **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

**Summary**

<style>
table, th, td {
    border: 1px solid black;
    border-collapse: collapse;
}
</style>

| Principle | Description | Benefit |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| SRP       | A class should have only one reason to change. | Improves maintainability |
| OCP       | Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. | Makes adding features easier. |
| LSP       | Subclasses should be replaceable with base classes. | Prevents broken inheritance. |
| ISP       | Interfaces should be smaller, specific, not large	. | Avoids unnecessary method implementations. |
| DIP       | High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not concrete classes. | Enables flexibility and testability. |

These principles help build **scalable, maintainable, and testable** Java applications. ðŸš€
