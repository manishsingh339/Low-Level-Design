**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.

>**Large interfaces** should be **split** into **smaller, more specific ones.**

**Problem:** Robot doesn't need eat() but is forced to implement it.

âœ… Benefits:

> Classes **only implement what they need.**

> **Prevents unnecessary dependencies.**
