**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
A class should have only one reason to change.

1. Each class should have **only one responsibility** (one job).
2. This improves **modularity** and **reduces coupling**.

**Problem:** The class has two responsibilities: salary calculation and report generation.

âœ… **Benefits**:

1. Makes classes easier to maintain and test.
2. Avoids unnecessary changes affecting unrelated functionality.
