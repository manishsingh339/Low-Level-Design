**Inheritance (Code Reusability)**

Inheritance allows a class (child/subclass) to acquire properties and behaviors from another class (parent/superclass). 
It enables code reuse.

ðŸ”¹ **Types of Inheritance in Java:**

> Single: One class inherits another.
> 
> Multilevel: A class inherits from another class, which is itself inherited from another class.
> 
> Hierarchical: Multiple classes inherit from a single parent.
> 
>Multiple Inheritance via Interfaces: Java does not support multiple inheritance directly but allows it 
> using interfaces.
