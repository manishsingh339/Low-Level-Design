**Polymorphism (Method Overriding & Overloading)**

Polymorphism allows objects to take multiple forms by having the same method name but different behavior.

ðŸ”¹ **A. Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism):**

> Same method name, but different parameters (within the same class).

ðŸ”¹ **B. Method Overriding (Run-time Polymorphism):**

> Same method name, same parameters, but different behavior (inherited from a parent class).
>
> Subclass provides a different implementation of a method defined in the parent class.

**ðŸ”¹ Key Differences:**
>Overloading: Compile-time polymorphism (resolved at compile-time).
> 
>Overriding: Runtime polymorphism (resolved at runtime).
